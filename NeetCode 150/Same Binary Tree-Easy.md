## Question
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, return true if the trees are equivalent, otherwise return false.
Two binary trees are considered equivalent if they share the exact same structure and the nodes have the same values.
### Example 1:



```java
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]

Output: true

```
### Example 2:



```java
Input: p = [4,7], q = [4,null,7]

Output: false

```
### Example 3:



```java
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,3,2]

Output: false

```
Constraints:
0 <= The number of nodes in both trees <= 100.
-100 <= Node.val <= 100


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
