## Question
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: s = "zxyzxyz"

Output: 3

```
Explanation: The string "xyz" is the longest without duplicate characters.
### Example 2:


```java
Input: s = "xxxx"

Output: 1

```
Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 1000
s may consist of printable ASCII characters.


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(m) space, where n is the length of the string and m is the number of unique characters in the string.
