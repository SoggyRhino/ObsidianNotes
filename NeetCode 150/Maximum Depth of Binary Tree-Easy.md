## Question
Given the root of a binary tree, return its depth.
The depth of a binary tree is defined as the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
### Example 1:



```java
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4]

Output: 3

```
### Example 2:


```java
Input: root = []

Output: 0

```
Constraints:
0 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 100.
-100 <= Node.val <= 100


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
