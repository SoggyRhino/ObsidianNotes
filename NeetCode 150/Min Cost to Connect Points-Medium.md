## Question
You are given a 2-D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi]. Each points[i] represents a distinct point on a 2-D plane.
The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between the two points, i.e. |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|.
Return the minimum cost to connect all points together, such that there exists exactly one path between each pair of points.
### Example 1:



```java
Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,3],[2,4],[4,2]]

Output: 10

```
Constraints:
1 <= points.length <= 1000
-1000 <= xi, yi <= 1000


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution as good or better than O((n^2)logn) time and O(n^2) space, where n is the number of points.
