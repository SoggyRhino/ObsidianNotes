## Question
Within a binary tree, a node x is considered good if the path from the root of the tree to the node x contains no nodes with a value greater than the value of node x
Given the root of a binary tree root, return the number of good nodes within the tree.
### Example 1:



```java
Input: root = [2,1,1,3,null,1,5]

Output: 3

```

### Example 2:


```java
Input: root = [1,2,-1,3,4]

Output: 4

```
Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes in the tree <= 100
-100 <= Node.val <= 100


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time andO(n) space, where n is the number of nodes in the given tree.
