## Question
You are given an integer n representing the number of steps to reach the top of a staircase. You can climb with either 1 or 2 steps at a time.
Return the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of the staircase.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: n = 2

Output: 2

```
Explanation:
1 + 1 = 2
2 = 2
### Example 2:


```java
Input: n = 3

Output: 3

```
Explanation:
1 + 1 + 1 = 3
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 1 = 3
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 30


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution as good or better than O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the number of steps.
