## Question
You are given a non-empty array of integers nums. Every integer appears twice except for one.
Return the integer that appears only once.
You must implement a solution with O(n)O(n)O(n) runtime complexity and use only O(1)O(1)O(1) extra space.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: nums = [3,2,3]

Output: 2

```
### Example 2:


```java
Input: nums = [7,6,6,7,8]

Output: 8

```
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10000
-10000 <= nums[i] <= 10000
