## Question
You are given the beginning of a linked list head, and an integer n.
Remove the nth node from the end of the list and return the beginning of the list.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: head = [1,2,3,4], n = 2

Output: [1,2,4]

```
### Example 2:


```java
Input: head = [5], n = 1

Output: []

```
### Example 3:


```java
Input: head = [1,2], n = 2

Output: [2]

```
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is sz.
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(N) time and O(1) space, where N is the length of the given list.
