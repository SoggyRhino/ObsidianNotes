## Question
Given an integer array nums, find a subarray that has the largest product within the array and return it.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
You can assume the output will fit into a 32-bit integer.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: nums = [1,2,-3,4]

Output: 4

```
### Example 2:


```java
Input: nums = [-2,-1]

Output: 2

```
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10
