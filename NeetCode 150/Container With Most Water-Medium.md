## Question
You are given an integer array heights where heights[i] represents the height of the ithi^{th}ith bar.
You may choose any two bars to form a container. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
### Example 1:



```java
Input: height = [1,7,2,5,4,7,3,6]

Output: 36

```
### Example 2:


```java
Input: height = [2,2,2]

Output: 4

```
Constraints:
2 <= height.length <= 1000
0 <= height[i] <= 1000


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(1) space, where n is the size of the input array.
