## Question
You are given an array of k linked lists lists, where each list is sorted in ascending order.
Return the sorted linked list that is the result of merging all of the individual linked lists.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: lists = [[1,2,4],[1,3,5],[3,6]]

Output: [1,1,2,3,3,4,5,6]

```
### Example 2:


```java
Input: lists = []

Output: []

```
### Example 3:


```java
Input: lists = [[]]

Output: []

```
Constraints:
0 <= lists.length <= 1000
0 <= lists[i].length <= 100
-1000 <= lists[i][j] <= 1000


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution as good or better than O(n * k) time and O(1) space, where k is the total number of lists and n is the total number of nodes across all lists.
