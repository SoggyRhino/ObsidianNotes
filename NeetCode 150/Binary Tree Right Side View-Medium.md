## Question
You are given the root of a binary tree. Return only the values of the nodes that are visible from the right side of the tree, ordered from top to bottom.
### Example 1:



```java
Input: root = [1,2,3]

Output: [1,3]

```
### Example 2:


```java
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Output: [1,3,7]

```
Constraints:
0 <= number of nodes in the tree <= 100
-100 <= Node.val <= 100


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the number of nodes in the given tree.
