## Question
You are given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers. Each integer in nums is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
Every integer appears exactly once, except for one integer which appears two or more times. Return the integer that appears more than once.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: nums = [1,2,3,2,2]

Output: 2

```
### Example 2:


```java
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]

Output: 4

```
Follow-up: Can you solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using O(1)O(1)O(1) extra space?
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10000
nums.length == n + 1
1 <= nums[i] <= n


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(1) space, where n is the size of the input array.
