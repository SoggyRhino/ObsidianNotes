## Question
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other.
A queen in a chessboard can attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
Each solution contains a unique board layout where the queen pieces are placed. 'Q' indicates a queen and '.' indicates an empty space.
You may return the answer in any order.
### Example 1:



```java
Input: n = 4

Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]

```
Explanation: There are two different solutions to the 4-queens puzzle.
### Example 2:


```java
Input: n = 1

Output: [["Q"]]

```
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 8


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n!) time and O(n^2) space, where n is the size of the given square board.
