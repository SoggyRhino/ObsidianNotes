## Question
Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, otherwise return false.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. It is also case-insensitive and ignores all non-alphanumeric characters.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: s = "Was it a car or a cat I saw?"

Output: true

```
Explanation: After considering only alphanumerical characters we have "wasitacaroracatisaw", which is a palindrome.
### Example 2:


```java
Input: s = "tab a cat"

Output: false

```
Explanation: "tabacat" is not a palindrome.
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s is made up of only printable ASCII characters.


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(1) space, where n is the length of the input string.
