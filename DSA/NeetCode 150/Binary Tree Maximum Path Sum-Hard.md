## Question
Given the root of a non-empty binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes has an edge connecting them. A node can not appear in the sequence more than once. The path does not necessarily need to include the root.
The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
### Example 1:



```java
Input: root = [1,2,3]

Output: 6

```
Explanation: The path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
### Example 2:



```java
Input: root = [-15,10,20,null,null,15,5,-5]

Output: 40

```
Explanation: The path is 15 -> 20 -> 5 with a sum of 15 + 20 + 5 = 40.
Constraints:
1 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 1000.
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the number of nodes in the given tree.
