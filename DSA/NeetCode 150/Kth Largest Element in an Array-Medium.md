## Question
Given an unsorted array of integers nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.
By kth largest element, we mean the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
Follow-up: Can you solve it without sorting?
### Example 1:


```java
Input: nums = [2,3,1,5,4], k = 2

Output: 4

```
### Example 2:


```java
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,5,5,4], k = 3

Output: 4

```
Constraints:
1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10000
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution as good or better than O(nlogk) time and O(k) space, where n is the size of the input array, and k represents the rank of the largest number to be returned (i.e., the k-th largest element).
