## Question
Given an integer n, count the number of 1's in the binary representation of every number in the range [0, n].
Return an array output where output[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: n = 4

Output: [0,1,1,2,1]

```
Explanation:0 --> 01 --> 12 --> 103 --> 114 --> 100
Constraints:
0 <= n <= 1000
