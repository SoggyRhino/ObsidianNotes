## Question
Given a binary tree root, return the level order traversal of it as a nested list, where each sublist contains the values of nodes at a particular level in the tree, from left to right.
### Example 1:



```java
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Output: [[1],[2,3],[4,5,6,7]]

```
### Example 2:


```java
Input: root = [1]

Output: [[1]]

```
### Example 3:


```java
Input: root = []

Output: []

```
Constraints:
0 <= The number of nodes in both trees <= 1000.
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the number of nodes in the given tree.
