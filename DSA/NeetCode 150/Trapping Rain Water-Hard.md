## Question
You are given an array non-negative integers height which represent an elevation map. Each value height[i] represents the height of a bar, which has a width of 1.
Return the maximum area of water that can be trapped between the bars.
### Example 1:



```java
Input: height = [0,2,0,3,1,0,1,3,2,1]

Output: 9

```
Constraints:
1 <= height.length <= 1000
0 <= height[i] <= 1000


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution as good or better than O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the size of the input array.
