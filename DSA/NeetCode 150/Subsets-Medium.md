## Question
Given an array nums of unique integers, return all possible subsets of nums.
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. You may return the solution in any order.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]

```
### Example 2:


```java
Input: nums = [7]

Output: [[],[7]]

```
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 10
-10 <= nums[i] <= 10


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n * (2^n)) time and O(n) space, where n is the size of the input array.
