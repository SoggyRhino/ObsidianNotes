## Question
Given a 32-bit unsigned integer n, reverse the bits of the binary representation of n and return the result.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000010101

Output:    2818572288 (10101000000000000000000000000000)

```
Explanation: Reversing 00000000000000000000000000010101, which represents the unsigned integer 21, gives us 10101000000000000000000000000000 which represents the unsigned integer 2818572288.
