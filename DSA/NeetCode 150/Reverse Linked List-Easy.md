## Question
Given the beginning of a singly linked list head, reverse the list, and return the new beginning of the list.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: head = [0,1,2,3]

Output: [3,2,1,0]

```
### Example 2:


```java
Input: head = []

Output: []

```
Constraints:
0 <= The length of the list <= 1000.
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(1) space, where n is the length of the given list.
