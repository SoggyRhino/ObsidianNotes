## Question
Given a string s, return the longest substring of s that is a palindrome.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
If there are multiple palindromic substrings that have the same length, return any one of them.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: s = "ababd"

Output: "bab"

```
Explanation: Both "aba" and "bab" are valid answers.
### Example 2:


```java
Input: s = "abbc"

Output: "bb"

```
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s contains only digits and English letters.


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution as good or better than O(n^2) time and O(1) space, where n is the length of the given string.
