## Question
You are given a string digits made up of digits from 2 through 9 inclusive.
Each digit (not including 1) is mapped to a set of characters as shown below:
A digit could represent any one of the characters it maps to.
Return all possible letter combinations that digits could represent. You may return the answer in any order.

### Example 1:


```java
Input: digits = "34"

Output: ["dg","dh","di","eg","eh","ei","fg","fh","fi"]

```
### Example 2:


```java
Input: digits = ""

Output: []

```
Constraints:
0 <= digits.length <= 4
2 <= digits[i] <= 9


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n * (4^n)) time and O(n) space, where n is the length of the input string.
