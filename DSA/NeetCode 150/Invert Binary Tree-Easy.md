## Question
You are given the root of a binary tree root. Invert the binary tree and return its root.
### Example 1:



```java
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Output: [1,3,2,7,6,5,4]

```
### Example 2:



```java
Input: root = [3,2,1]

Output: [3,1,2]

```
### Example 3:


```java
Input: root = []

Output: []

```
Constraints:
0 <= The number of nodes in the tree <= 100.
-100 <= Node.val <= 100


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
