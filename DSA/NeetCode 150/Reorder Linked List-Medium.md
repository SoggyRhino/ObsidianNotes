## Question
You are given the head of a singly linked-list.
The positions of a linked list of length = 7 for example, can intially be represented as:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Reorder the nodes of the linked list to be in the following order:
[0, 6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3]
Notice that in the general case for a list of length = n the nodes are reordered to be in the following order:
[0, n-1, 1, n-2, 2, n-3, ...]
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, but instead you must reorder the nodes themselves.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: head = [2,4,6,8]

Output: [2,8,4,6]

```
### Example 2:


```java
Input: head = [2,4,6,8,10]

Output: [2,10,4,8,6]

```
Constraints:
1 <= Length of the list <= 1000.
1 <= Node.val <= 1000


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(1) space, where n is the length of the given list.
