## Question
Given a binary tree, return true if it is height-balanced and false otherwise.
A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.
### Example 1:



```java
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4]

Output: true

```
### Example 2:



```java
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,null,5]

Output: false

```
### Example 3:


```java
Input: root = []

Output: true

```
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 1000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with O(n) time and O(n) space, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
