## Question
Given a string s, return the number of substrings within s that are palindromes.
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
### Example 1:


```java
Input: s = "abc"

Output: 3

```
Explanation: "a", "b", "c".
### Example 2:


```java
Input: s = "aaa"

Output: 6

```
Explanation: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa". Note that different substrings are counted as different palindromes even if the string contents are the same.
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of lowercase English letters.


### Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution as good or better than O(n^2) time and O(1) space, where n is the length of the given string.
